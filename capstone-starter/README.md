# Project Title

## Description of the Project

EZ-Shop is a Java-based RESTful web application designed to support a simple e-commerce platform. It enables users to browse products, manage categories, and perform CRUD operations securely. The project serves as a learning tool for understanding Java Spring Boot APIs, security with role-based access, and integration with front-end clients or tools like Postman. Intended users include developers exploring RESTful API design and small businesses interested in basic inventory and catalog management systems.

## User Stories

- As a shopper, I want to browse products by category so that I can easily find items I'm interested in.


- As an admin, I want to add, update, and delete products and categories so that I can keep the catalog up to date.


- As a user, I want to register and log in so that I can access personalized features.


- As a developer, I want clear API endpoints so that I can integrate this backend with a front-end application.


- As an admin, I want secure role-based access so that unauthorized users canâ€™t modify data.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
